# Unicode Keyboard

## About

This is a custom-made keyboard created by me with some help from the internet to create a keyboard that allows for the insertion of Unicode characters without too much trouble.

* Works on any Jelly Bean device or later
* Is an actual keyboard, so you can access it from any app
* Breaks if you try to do stupid things
* Works
